<p>As you know, <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3620" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a lambda expression is a function that is not bound to a name (an anonymous function) and can be assigned to a variable. | It consists of a list of parameters followed by the body that can return a value. Lambda expressions are often used to pass a block of code as data to a method. They allow for more readable and concise code, and can be used in place of method references. Lambda expressions have a special type, and there are several types of lambda expressions defined in the Java standard library, such as Function and Predicate, both located in the java.util.function package.">lambda expressions</a> allow you to use code as data and pass it as a method's arguments. Another way to do it is to use <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3620" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a method reference is a way to refer to a specific method by its name, which can be invoked at any time it is needed. | It is a more readable and easier to test alternative to lambda expressions. Method references can refer to both standard and custom methods. There are four kinds of method references: reference to a static method, reference to an instance method of an existing object, reference to an instance method of an object of a particular type, and reference to a constructor. For example, a reference to a static method can be created using the following general form: `ContainingClass::staticMethodName`.">method references</a>. They are often even more readable than corresponding lambda expressions. Besides, method references force developers to decompose a program into a set of short methods with clear areas of responsibility.</p>
<h5 id="make-code-clearer-with-method-references">Make code clearer with method references</h5>
<p>By method reference, we mean a function that refers to a particular method via its name and can be invoked any time we need it. The base syntax of a method reference looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">objectOrClass :: methodName</code></pre>
<p>where <code class="language-java">objectOrClass</code> can be a <strong>class name</strong> or a <strong>particular instance</strong> of a class.</p>
<p>Here is an example, we create a reference to the standard <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3620" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a static method is a method that is associated with a class rather than an instance of a class. | It can be accessed directly using the class name and does not require the creation of a class instance. A static method can only access static fields and other static methods within the same class, and cannot refer to the `this` keyword because there is no instance context. Static methods are often used as utility methods that provide common functionality for the entire project. They can be called from instance methods, but not the other way around.">static method</a> <code class="language-java">max</code> of the <code class="language-java">Integer</code> class.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">BiFunction&lt;Integer, Integer, Integer&gt; max = Integer::max;</code></pre>
<p>Here, <code class="language-java">Integer::max</code> is a method reference to a static method.</p>
<p>This code works because the definition of the method <code class="language-java">int max(int a, int b)</code> fits the type <code class="language-java">BiFunction&lt;Integer, Integer, Integer&gt;</code>: they both mean taking two integer arguments and returning an integer value.</p>
<p></p>
<div class="alert alert-primary"><p>You may already know that <code class="language-java">BiFunction&lt;Integer, Integer, Integer&gt;</code> is not the only way to create a suitable object in this case. It is possible to use <code class="language-java">IntBinaryOperator</code> and some other classes. We will consider them in other topics.</p></div>
<p></p>
<p>Now we have the <code class="language-java">max</code> object that can be used as a function by invoking the <code class="language-java">apply</code> method. Let's invoke it!</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">System.out.println(max.apply(50, 70)); // 70</code></pre>
<p>So, once assigned to an object, a method reference works in the same way as a lambda expression.</p>
<p>Here is an alternative way to create the same object using a lambda expression:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">BiFunction&lt;Integer, Integer, Integer&gt; max = (x, y) -&gt; Integer.max(x, y);</code></pre>
<p>It is recommended to use method references rather than lambda expressions if you just need to invoke a standard method without other operations. Your code will be shorter, more readable, and easier to test.</p>
<p></p>
<div class="alert alert-primary"><p>Note that we can refer to both standard and our custom methods using method references.</p></div>
<p></p>
<h5 id="kinds-of-method-references">Kinds of method references</h5>
<p>It's possible to write method references to both static and instance (non-static) methods.</p>
<p>In general, there are four kinds of method references:</p>
<ul><li><p>reference to a static method;</p></li><li><p>reference to an <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3620" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, an instance method is a method that belongs to each object created of a particular class. | It can access fields of the specific object of the class. For example, if we have a class with two instance methods: method1() and method2(), and two objects: object1 and object2, the output of these methods will be different for each object because they have different values for the fields. To use an instance method, you must first create an object.">instance method</a> of an existing object;</p></li><li><p>reference to an instance method of an object of a particular type;</p></li><li><p>reference to a constructor.</p></li></ul>
<p><strong>1) Reference to a static method</strong></p>
<p>The general form is the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">ClassName :: staticMethodName</code></pre>
<p>Let's take a look at the reference to the static method <code class="language-java">sqrt</code><strong> </strong>of the class <code class="language-java">Math</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">Function&lt;Double, Double&gt; sqrt = Math::sqrt;</code></pre>
<p>Now we can invoke the <code class="language-java">sqrt</code> method for double values:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">sqrt.apply(100.0d); // the result is 10.0d</code></pre>
<p>The <code class="language-java">sqrt</code> method can also be written using the following lambda expression:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">Function&lt;Double, Double&gt; sqrt = x -&gt; Math.sqrt(x);</code></pre>
<p><strong>2) Reference to an instance method of an object</strong></p>
<p>The general form looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">objectName :: instanceMethodName</code></pre>
<p>Let's check out the example of a reference to the <code class="language-java">indexOf</code> method of a particular string.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">String whatsGoingOnText = "What's going on here?";

Function&lt;String, Integer&gt; indexWithinWhatsGoingOnText = whatsGoingOnText::indexOf;</code></pre>
<p>Here is the result of applying it to different arguments:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">System.out.println(indexWithinWhatsGoingOnText.apply("going")); // 7
System.out.println(indexWithinWhatsGoingOnText.apply("Hi"));    // -1</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, actually we always work with the <code class="language-java">whatsGoingOnText</code> object captured from the context.</p>
<p>The following example of a lambda expression is a full equivalent of the reference above and can make your understanding of the situation better:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">Function&lt;String, Integer&gt; indexWithinWhatsGoingOnText = string -&gt; whatsGoingOnText.indexOf(string);
</code></pre>
<p><strong>3) Reference to an instance method of an object of a particular type</strong></p>
<p>Here is a general form of a reference:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">ClassName :: instanceMethodName</code></pre>
<p>In that case, you need to pass an instance of the class as the function argument.</p>
<p>Let's focus on the following reference to an instance of the method <code class="language-java">doubleValue</code> of the class <code class="language-java">Long</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">Function&lt;Long, Double&gt; converter = Long::doubleValue;</code></pre>
<p>Now we can invoke the <code class="language-java">converter</code> for long values:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">converter.apply(100L); // the result is 100.0d
converter.apply(200L); // the result is 200.0d</code></pre>
<p>Also, we can write the same converter using the following lambda expression:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">Function&lt;Long, Double&gt; converter = val -&gt; val.doubleValue();</code></pre>
<p><strong>4) Reference to a constructor</strong></p>
<p>This reference has the following <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3620" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a declaration is a statement that introduces a variable, method, or class into the program. | It specifies the type of the entity being declared, its name, and other relevant information such as access modifiers, return type (for methods), and initial values (for variables). For example, the declaration of a method may include its name, return type, access modifier, and parameter list. Declarations are essential for Java to understand the structure and behavior of the program. Incorrect declarations can lead to compilation errors. Java 10 introduced type inference, which allows developers to use the var keyword instead of a specific type, and the type is automatically inferred based on the assigned value.">declaration</a>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">ClassName :: new</code></pre>
<p>For example, let's consider our <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3620" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a custom class is a user-defined class that you create to serve a specific purpose in your program. | It allows you to define fields (also known as variables or data members) and methods that are tailored to your needs. Fields hold the current state of an instance of the class, and their values can vary for different instances. Custom classes can be used to create objects, assign values to their fields, and use those objects in your program.">custom class</a> <code class="language-java">Person</code> with a single field <code class="language-java">name</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">class Person {
    String name;

    public Person(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>Here is a reference to the constructor of this class:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">Function&lt;String, Person&gt; personGenerator = Person::new;</code></pre>
<p>This function produces new <code class="language-java">Person</code> objects based on their names.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">Person johnFoster = personGenerator.apply("John Foster"); // we have a John Foster object</code></pre>
<p>Here is the corresponding lambda expression that does the same.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">Function&lt;String, Person&gt; personGenerator = name -&gt; new Person(name);</code></pre>
<p>Further, we will use lambda expressions and method references together.</p>
<p></p>
<div class="alert alert-primary"><p>More practical examples will be explored in the following topics. For now, it is enough to grasp the general idea and the syntax of method references.</p></div>
<p></p>
<h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5>
<p>You've learned a new way to create function objects by using method references. It has much in common with lambda expressions but allows writing more readable and decomposed code. At the end of this topic, you should memorize all four types of method references and be ready to use them in your programs when you need to convey a piece of code into some method.</p>
